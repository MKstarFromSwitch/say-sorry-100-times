<h1>Say Sorry (or anything you want) 100 times</h1>

With this JavaScript, you can say anything you want 100 (or however much you want to say it) times.

How to say anything you want 100 times:

1. Download say.js.
2. Right-click say.js, and select Edit in Notepad.
3. Find the code line console.log(i + " REPLACE ME "); then replace the "REPLACE ME" text with something else.
4. Star the repository (not required)
   
Submit a pull request or open an issue for issues, new code, suggestions, new files for the repository, or grammar correction to the README.

WARNING:
- I NEVER obfuscate my codes. Do not run scripts or Tampermonkey scripts that you don't know the code for/if they're obfuscated. They could cause harm to your accounts! (For example, an obfuscated script might be a token/cookie grabber and may grab your token/cookie for the target account. The token/cookie allows someone to log in as you and do whatever they want bypassing all 2FA, and the password. Your accounts could be leaked from this!)
- Be careful on GitHub. Never run code you don't know. It could harm your computer, leak your personal info or accounts!
