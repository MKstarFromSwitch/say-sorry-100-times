<h1>Say Sorry (or anything you want) 100 times</h1>

With this JavaScript (or C script, not to be confused with cscript.exe), you can say anything you want 100 (or however much you want to say it) times.

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR JS. CHECK OUT <a href=https://github.com/MKstarFromSwitch/say-sorry-100-times/blob/main/C-INSTRUCTIONS.md>C-INSTRUCTIONS.md</a> FOR INSTRUCTIONS IN C.

WARNING:
- I NEVER obfuscate my codes. Do not run scripts or Tampermonkey scripts that you don't know the code for/if they're obfuscated. They could cause harm to your accounts! (For example, an obfuscated script might be a token/cookie grabber and may grab your token/cookie for the target account. The token/cookie allows someone to log in as you and do whatever they want bypassing all 2FA, and the password. Your accounts could be leaked from this!)
- Be careful on GitHub. Never run code you don't know. It could harm your computer, leak your personal info or accounts!
